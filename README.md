# Utilizing-Sentiment-and-Historical-Data-Analyses-to-Predict-DJIA-Market-Behavior

Predicting fluctuations of stock indexes or specific stocks has always been an interesting topic to many financial experts. There are countless factors to account for in predicting the correct trends of the market. Having a surplus amount of data is only the first step in trying to understand the complexities of the market. Utilizing data from different sources is the key in gaining a competitive advantage in predicting the correct movement. Many studies have been published about forecasting the stock market, usually based on technical and fundamental analyses. However, few studies offer different approaches such as sentiment analysis on major social media platforms or company websites. In this project, I used sentiment analysis on the top headlines from Reddit during 2016 to determine increases or decreases in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The primary objective of this project was to convert these headlines into actionable values to construct an efficient model with optimized accuracy. Predictions of this model had an accuracy of 52%. Later I tried combining the sentiments with gold and oil prices in the same period. However, the results appeared to have a lower accuracy than the sentiment approach.
